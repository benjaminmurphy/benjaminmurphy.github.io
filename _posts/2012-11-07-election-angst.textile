title: Election Angst
spoiler: It's election night, meaning countless people across the country will be eagerly following special election coverage on the television, radio or computer. I've tried to resist, and I've reminded myself countless times that I'll be more productive if I wait until morning to discover the headlines. Alas, I now find myself flicking through pages of exit polls, reporting precincts and so-called "expert" predictions. NBC, CNN, The New York Times, ABC. Many will put a state in the wrong column, and several will have made the right guess at the end of the night. Of course, I'm actively discounting those who disagree with my pick for president, and putting those who agree on a pedestal. While waiting for West Coast polls to close, my mind has wandered, and I now ask myself, "Why do I care?"

    By refreshing each website on a minute-by-minute basis, I gain nothing besides a chance of carpal tunnel. At the moment, only one state (Indiana) has been officially called. Staying up to see the final result seems even more ludicrous - I'll be tired in my classes tomorrow, and the only mitigating factor is the chance of posting the first official result on Facebook. My outrage or approval can't change anything. Nevertheless, I'll be checking rapidly to see if Obama won Wisconsin, or if Romney is gaining in Florida.
 
    The immediacy of the election changes how I consider it: Within ten or twelve hours, we'll know the next leader of our country. Unlike many other highly anticipated events, such as the Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act, the time for speculation is short, so my mind is in an overdrive; analyzing, considering and hoping. It's impossible to turn away now, not when the months of campaigning are at a close. In addition, the social pressure is immense: I have to tweet and post in revel or revolt simultaneously, not a minute late. For tonight, you'll find me bathed in the light of my computer screen as the states are divided, until only one candidate emerges out of the election day brawl.</div>
