title: The Lack of Education Reform
spoiler: The state parliament in Berlin has some unusual new legislators in their ranks; fifteen members of the Pirate Party entered office because of their claim of an impressive 8.9 percent of the vote. And no, not the Blackbeard kind of pirate. Pirate Parties International is the worldwide organization associated with the Pirate Party movement, whose overall goal is ”promoting global legislation to facilitate the emerging information society”. On their agenda? Three primary issues: copyright reform, abolishing the patent system, and respecting the right for privacy.

    The recently concluded presidential race has been a long one. From the 47% remark to the first debate to the Republican primaries, there have been countless blunders, victories and discussions. President Obama and Governor Romney discussed countless topics, from abortion to foreign policy to immigration reform. The debate was notably sparse in one area of policy: education reform. What little discourse existed primarily focused on subsidies for college tuition, and increasing enrollment in higher education. We need a serious conversation in this country about K-12 reform.
    According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, one out of three students in America scored "below basic" on the 2009 NAEP, and we rank 25th for math education in the world. To compound the problem, universities and colleges are becoming increasingly selective as more students apply from across the world. To remain competitive in a fierce global economy, we must ensure that our students get a top-tier education.
    Now that President Obama has won re-election, many people are expecting him to focus on more controversial topics, such as education and climate change. Rahm Emanuel, both Obama's ex-Chief of Staff and the Mayor of Chicago, has recently instituted major changes in the Chicago school system, including extending the school day, increasing the number of charter schools and tying teacher pay more directly to test scores. Although this reform may have been slightly over-the-top, President Obama could take a few cues from Emanuel.
    To me, three deficiencies stand out: math, reading and science. Each of these problems has three levels: curriculum, teaching and home involvement. Our curriculum issues are the easiest to solve - In math and science, we need to focus on a hands-on approach, complete with problem solving and critical thinking. As for reading and other humanities, we need to develop a challenging program that instills students with a desire to read, learn and explore.
    On average, we have good teachers. Limited funds, huge classes and shrinking class time make the job a true challenge. However, I know of a fundamental problem that many students experience, especially in elementary math and science: Educators may not completely understand what they're teaching. When a student doesn't understand a concept, it is the teacher's job to rework it and present it in a new form, something that is impossible if they do not have a thorough understanding of the principles of, for example, carrying or borrowing.
    I'd like to conclude with what I view as the most serious problem: parental and home involvement. When a student returns home after school, it is critical that their parents ask about their day, homework and classes, so as to ensure that the student is keeping up and understanding concepts. If they don't, it's the role of the parent to work with the child. Similarly, it is equally important that the student retain any information while at home, especially over the summer. Studies have shown that students may lose as much as 50% of the information they learned during summer break. One solution to this problem would be to lengthen the school year. Another would be to increase access to extracurricular summer activities that foster learning.
    In total, I believe that parental involvement and retention are the two most serious problems plaguing our education system. Fixing them, along with the numerous other issues, is a difficult task. However, I trust in President Obama and his administration to realize the significance of the task, and to get the work done.</div>
