                <div id="about-div">I’m Ben Murphy. I’m soon to be a student at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, graduating in 2018. Although I haven’t declared my concentration yet, I’m a computer scientist and mathematician at heart.  At the moment, I’m busy teaching myself about web development, alongside various projects using Objective-C and Python. I’m also a top-ranked math competitor in Maine, my home state.

At the moment, I live in the middle of nowhere. I’ve been homeschooled until last year, when I took a gap year before entering college. Outside of computer science and math, I’m fascinated by psychology and education, and I fill a large portion of my time reading and writing about world politics. I also teach introductory programming classes in my community, and soon, hopefully, on YouTube. I’ve been blogging since I was nine, and I use this website as a forum to respond to articles I’ve read, along with events in my life.

Outside of academics, I’m an ultimate frisbee fanatic, an amateur photographer, and a gamer. I play League of Legends, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft, but I previously was a pretty good StarCraft player. I also have a wonderful dog, Buddy, who is featured in a few photographs on the website.

On the sidebar, you can find my full résumé, along with a gallery of some selected photographs. You can contact me at benjamin_murphy@me.com, or at benjamin_murphy@brown.edu.</div>
